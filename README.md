# Irrigation_controller_arduino_due
A basic project for control an irrigation system with Arduino Due

This is my first big project with Arduino Due, last updated on 21 June 2013, I'm not sure if the code still works.
I also used the Arduino-Due-RTC-Library, you can find it here: https://github.com/MarkusLange/Arduino-Due-RTC-Library
My code is horrible, there's a lot of repeats because I did it as a school project and that way it seemed that I wrote a lot.
